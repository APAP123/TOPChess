# TOPChess
Final project assignment from The Odin Project's Ruby section.

The goal here was to create a playable, feature-complete version of Chess in Ruby.

Note that when the game refers to "white" and "black" pieces, the color of said pieces can actually be the opposite of what is described depending on the color scheme of the terminal. 
Just remember that white's on the bottom and black's on the top and you'll have no problems.
